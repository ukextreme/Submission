# 🛠️ Configurable Workflow Engine – .NET 8 Minimal API

This project is a backend service that implements a **configurable workflow engine** using **.NET 8 Minimal APIs**. The system is modeled as a **state machine**, enabling dynamic workflow definitions, controlled state transitions, and strict rule enforcement at runtime.

---

## ✅ What This Project Does

It lets clients:
1. **Define a workflow** – States (initial/final) and Transitions (actions)
2. **Start a workflow instance** – Begins at the initial state of the definition
3. **Perform transitions (actions)** – Moves the instance from one state to another if valid
4. **View definitions and instances** – For inspection and tracking

## ⚙️ How It Works – End to End

### 1. **Workflow Definition**
A workflow definition is a blueprint that describes:
- A set of **states**:
  - Each with an `Id`
  - One and only one must be marked `IsInitial = true`
  - Any number can be marked `IsFinal = true`
- A set of **transitions** (actions):
  - Each has a `Name` (unique)
  - One `ToStateId` (destination state)
  - One or more `FromStateIds` (source states)

Example:
```json
{
  "id": "ticket-approval",
  "states": [
    { "id": "Open", "isInitial": true },
    { "id": "Approved" },
    { "id": "Closed", "isFinal": true }
  ],
  "transitions": [
    { "name": "approve", "fromStateIds": ["Open"], "toStateId": "Approved" },
    { "name": "close", "fromStateIds": ["Approved"], "toStateId": "Closed" }
  ]
}
